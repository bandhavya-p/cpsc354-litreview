# README: Exploring Trade-offs Between Interpreted and Compiled Languages

## Author: Bandhavya Parvathaneni

## Overview

This repository presents an investigation into the trade-offs between **interpreted** and **compiled** programming languages, particularly focusing on **performance** and **development speed**. The exploration also delves into hybrid techniques like **Just-in-Time (JIT) compilation**, used in languages such as **Python** and **C++**, and their impact on performance-critical tasks. 

I used **OpenAI's GPT-4** as my primary **Large Language Model (LLM)** for this exploration, asking a series of focused questions to dig into the historical, technical, and research-oriented aspects of this topic. Below are the summarized findings, along with questions asked during the process and key references that provide context.

## Main Question

### What are the trade-offs between interpreted and compiled languages in terms of performance and development speed?

**Summary:**

- **Compiled languages** like C and C++ offer superior performance but require more development time due to the need for compilation. They are often chosen for performance-critical applications (e.g., game engines, operating systems).
- **Interpreted languages** such as Python provide faster development cycles since no recompilation is needed, but they sacrifice performance due to the overhead of interpretation.
- **JIT compilation** bridges the gap between these two paradigms by compiling code at runtime, optimizing for performance without sacrificing development flexibility (e.g., JavaScript's V8 engine).

## Subquestions Explored

### 1. How do modern languages like Python (interpreted) and C++ (compiled) handle performance-critical tasks?

Using the LLM, I found that **C++** is still preferred for applications where high performance is crucial, due to its compiled nature and the efficiency of machine-level execution. However, **Python**, though slower due to its interpreted nature, has seen performance boosts through implementations like **PyPy** (a JIT-compiled version of Python) and external libraries (e.g., **NumPy** and **Cython**), allowing Python to be used in fields like data science and machine learning, where performance is key.

### 2. What are the advantages of just-in-time (JIT) compilation in balancing performance and flexibility?

The LLM highlighted that **JIT compilation**, used in platforms like the **Java Virtual Machine (JVM)** and **Google’s V8 engine** (for JavaScript), compiles code at runtime rather than before execution. This allows optimizations based on the actual workload, offering a middle ground between the performance of compiled languages and the development speed of interpreted languages.

> **Question asked:** What are the benefits of JIT compilation for interpreted languages like JavaScript?

## Historical Context

The exploration revealed that the division between compiled and interpreted languages started with **Fortran** and **C** on the compiled side, and **Lisp** and **BASIC** on the interpreted side. Initially, the choice between the two depended on the trade-off between performance (favoring compiled) and ease of development (favoring interpreted). The rise of **JIT** in languages like **Java** and **JavaScript** evolved this conversation by offering dynamic optimizations.

## Notable Contributions to the Field

### Influential Researchers
- **Dennis Ritchie**: Creator of C, a highly optimized compiled language that remains influential in systems programming.
- **John McCarthy**: Known for Lisp, an early interpreted language, which influenced the development of dynamic languages like Python.
- **James Gosling**: Creator of **Java**, which brought **JIT** into mainstream programming through its use in the JVM.

### Key References

- **Google V8 Engine**: This JIT compiler has made JavaScript viable for high-performance applications.
- **LLVM Project**: A framework that has influenced both the static and JIT compilation strategies in modern languages.

## LLM Usage

For this literature review, I used **OpenAI's GPT-4**, which provided an effective overview of the technical distinctions between interpreted and compiled languages, as well as insights into how **JIT compilation** fits into the modern landscape. While GPT-4 generated most of the core content, I verified the facts using resources from **Google Scholar** and various reputable academic papers, which I linked below.

### Example Questions Asked:
1. How has JIT compilation influenced the performance of interpreted languages like JavaScript and Python?
2. What are the major historical developments in the trade-off between interpreted and compiled languages?
3. Who are the key researchers in the field of compiler theory?

## Key Learnings

- **Performance vs. Development Speed**: The tension between these two factors has shaped programming language design for decades, with hybrid solutions like JIT emerging to offer a balance.
- **JIT as a Bridge**: JIT compilation offers a middle path, especially for languages that need flexibility during development but also require performance during execution.
- **C++ and Python**: While Python can be slower, libraries like **NumPy** allow it to perform at C++ levels for specific use cases.
